    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>The Fart Gun</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 22 December 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>The Fart Gun</strong> (“the App”) handles information
        when you use it. The App is developed and published by
        <strong>Asif Imtiaz Ahmed</strong>, based in <strong>Canada</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We respect your privacy and are committed to transparency regarding data handling practices.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Scope of This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the App as distributed on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Play Store (Android)</li>
        <li>Apple App Store (iOS)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Collected by the App</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process personal data.
    </p>
    <p>The App does not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names or email addresses</li>
        <li>User accounts or login credentials</li>
        <li>Phone numbers</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Contacts, photos, or media files</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Local App Data</h3>
    <p>
        The App stores non-personal user preferences locally on your device only.
        This data never leaves the device and is deleted when the App is uninstalled.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Advertising</h3>
    <p>
        The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements.
        AdMob may collect certain information such as device data, advertising identifiers,
        and ad interaction metrics in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Google Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a>
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Analytics and Crash Reporting</h3>
    <p>
        The App uses <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> and limited analytics solely for
        stability and performance monitoring. These services may collect diagnostic
        information such as crash logs, device model, operating system version,
        and app version.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firebase Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
        </a>
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 Platform Services</h3>
    <p>
        The App is distributed via Google Play Services and the Apple App Store.
        These platforms may collect information independently according to their
        own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App is intended for a general audience. It does not knowingly collect
        personal data from children. There is no age verification mechanism in place.
        Ads are served through Google AdMob without developer-controlled
        age-based personalization settings.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal data is stored on developer-controlled servers</li>
        <li>The App functions entirely offline except for advertising</li>
        <li>All locally stored data remains on the user’s device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. User Rights and Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>
        The App is designed to comply with major global privacy regulations,
        including GDPR (EU/UK), CCPA/CPRA (California), COPPA (United States),
        and PIPEDA (Canada).
    </p>
    <p>
        Because the App does not collect personal data directly, most data access
        or deletion requests should be directed to the relevant third-party providers.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be reflected
        by updating the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
    </p>
